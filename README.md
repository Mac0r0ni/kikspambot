# Kik Bot API #
This is a modification to kik-bot-api-unofficial and can be used as a spam bot.
## Installation and dependencies ##
First, make sure you are using **Python 3.6+**, not python 2.7. 

** (Do this before installing the api)
If you are using [Termux](https://termux.com/), then use `pkg install libxml2 libxslt` to install `lxml` and `pkg install zlib libpng libjpeg-turbo` to install `pillow` dependencies.

## Installation ## (this may take a while so be patient)
$ git clone -b new https://github.com/Sitiaro/Spambot **

$ pip3 install ./Spambot

## Usage ##
$ cd Spambot

$ python spambot.py

Login with the username and password of your spam account, add it to your friend list by typing 'friend' in the bot's dms and add it to the chat you want to spam. Once you do so, use .spam (no. of messages) to spam the chat.

## For educational purposes only. This may lead to your account getting banned from kik so use it at your own expense. ##
